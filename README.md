## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Modern JS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to manage 'global state' using React's Context API and useContext hook

### Useful resources

- (https://github.com/axios/axios) - Axios helped me for fetching the data from the API, its actually the first time to use axios I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&t=34690s) - This is an amazing 'from zero to hero' React tutorial by the amazing John Smilga. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning react.
